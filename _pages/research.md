Below, after a short description of my research interests, you can find a list of my published works. For a list of my recent talks, [click here](https://www.robertpassmann.eu/talks).

In *mathematical logic*, I'm mainly concerned with investigating logical properties of (non-classical) foundational mathematical theories. For example, I recently proved that the first-order logical principles valid in CZF set theory are exactly those of intuitionistic first-order logic by using realizability techniques (see [this preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.00486)). I am also interested in nearby areas such as interpretations of modal logic (provability logics, modal logics of forcing, etc.), categorical logic, ordinal computability theory, and non-classical logics in general. 

My main interests in the *philosophy of logic* and the *philosophy of mathematics* are anti-exceptionalism about logic, the debate surrounding logical pluralism as well as connections between logical and mathematical pluralism. I am particularly curious about investigating the philosophical ramifications of results in mathematical logic and pondering mathematical questions which originate from philosophical problems.
