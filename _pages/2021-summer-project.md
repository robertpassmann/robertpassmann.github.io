We will read the book *Ordinal Computability* by Merlin Carl. The book is available via iDiscover [here](https://idiscover.lib.cam.ac.uk/permalink/f/i6hdf6/44CAM_ALMA51596317020003606). For each session, two students will prepare a talk of 30 minutes each, as specified below.

## First Meeting: Infinite Register Machines

We will read the first half of chapter 2, pp. 9 – 44 (not including section 2.4).

1. Sections 2.1 – 2.3.1. Simulation of machine models, halting problems, infinitary analogues of register machines, ITRMs with one register.
2. Sections 2.3.2 – 2.3.5. Coding transitive structures, testing well-foundedness, evluating truth predicates and other properties of structures, ordinal register machines.

## Second Meeting: Infinite Turing Machines

We will read the second half of chapter 2, pp. 44 – 74. 

1. Sections 2.4 – 2.5.3. Infinite time Turing machines: stack representation, computability notions, clockable ordinals.
2. Sections 2.5.4 – 2.7. alpha-ITTMs, weak ITTMs, ordinal Turing machines, absoluteness of computations, jump operator, further models.

Also consider the exercises in section 2.8.

## Third Meeting: Computability Strength I

We will read the first half of chapter 3, pp. 77 – 118.

1. Section 3.1 and 3.2. Preliminaries on L and admissibility. Computability strength of ORMs and alpha-register machines. The preliminaries on the constructible hierarchy and admissible sets and might require looking into other sources as well. 
2. Section 3.3 and 3.4. Computational strength of alpha-register machines, alpha-wITRMs and ITRMs.

Also consider exercises 3.9.1, 3.9.6.

## Fourth Meeting: Computability Strength II

We will read the second half of chapter 3, pp. 118 – 153.

1. Section 3.5 – 3.6.3. alpha-TMs and OTMs. First half on alpha-ITTMs and the Sigma_2 machine.
2. Section 3.6.4 - 3.8. Second half on alpha-ITTMS and Sigma_2 machine (consequences). Accidental and eventual writeability.

Consider the remaining exercises from 3.9.

## Fifth Meeting: Lost Melodies

We will read the first half of chapter 4, pp. 157 – 172.

1. Sections 4.1 – 4.2.1. Preliminaries on absoluteness results and truth predicates. Lost melodies on alpha-machines.
2. Section 4.2.2. Lost melodies on weak ITRMs. 

## Sixth Meeting: Recognizability

We will read the second half of chapter 4, pp. 172 – 193.

1. Section 4.3. Recognizability for ITRMs.
2. Sections 4.4 - 4.5. Recognizability for OTMs. Variants of recognizability.

Also consider the exercises in 4.7.
