We will read the book *Ordinal Computability* by Merlin Carl. The book is available via iDiscover [here](https://idiscover.lib.cam.ac.uk/permalink/f/i6hdf6/44CAM_ALMA51596317020003606). For each session, two students will prepare a talk of 30 minutes each, as specified below.

## First Meeting: 

In the first meeting we will be concerned with infinitary analogues of register machines. We will read the first half of chapter 2, pp. 9 – 44 (not including section 2.4).

1. pp. 9 – 30, Sections 2.1 – 2.3.1.
2. pp. 30 – 44, Sections 2.3.2 – 2.3.5.

## Second Meeting

In the second meeting, we will be concerned with infinitary analogues of Turing machines. We will read the second half of chapter 2, pp. 44 – 74. 

1. pp. 44 – 56, Sections 2.4 – 2.5.2.
2. pp. 56 – 74. Sections 2.5.3 – 2.7.

Also consider the exercises in section 2.8.

## Third Meeting

pp. 77 – 118

1. Section 3.1 and 3.2. Section 3.1 has preliminaries on the constructible hierarchy and admissible sets and might require looking into other sources as well. 
2. Section 3.3 and 3.4. 

## Fourth Meeting

pp. 118 – 153

1. Section 3.5 – 3.6.3.
