I am a PhD candidate at the [ILLC](http://www.illc.uva.nl), University of Amsterdam, under the supervision of [Professor Benedikt LÃ¶we](https://www.math.uni-hamburg.de/home/loewe/). My project is funded by a [doctoral scholarship](https://www.studienstiftung.de/en/promotion/) of the [Studienstiftung des deutschen Volkes](https://www.studienstiftung.de) (German Academic Scholarship Foundation). I'm interested in mathematical logic, the foundations of mathematics and their philosophy.
