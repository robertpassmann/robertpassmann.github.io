I'm a logician working interdisciplinary in philosophy and mathematics. In particular, my research interests span from mathematical and philosophical logic to the philosophy of logic and of mathematics. 

Currently, I'm a PhD candidate at the [Institute for Logic, Language and Computation](http://www.illc.uva.nl) (ILLC) of the [University of Amsterdam](http://www.uva.nl/) (Research Unit: Mathematical & Computational Logic). My supervisors are [Professor Benedikt LÃ¶we](https://www.math.uni-hamburg.de/home/loewe/) and [Professor Rosalie Iemhoff](https://www.uu.nl/medewerkers/RIemhoff). My research is funded by a [doctoral scholarship](https://www.studienstiftung.de/en/promotion/) of the [Studienstiftung des deutschen Volkes](https://www.studienstiftung.de). 

### News

- I co-organised the first [*Dutch Logic PhD Day*](http://www.verenigingvoorlogica.nl/en/Dutch-Logic-PhD-Day-2022/) ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡±, which took place on 1 July.
- I visited the [Bergen Logic Group](https://www.uib.no/en/rg/logic) ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡´ in May.
