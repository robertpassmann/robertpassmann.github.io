I am a PhD candidate at the [Institute for Logic, Language and Computation](http://www.illc.uva.nl), University of Amsterdam, under the supervision of [Professor Benedikt Löwe](https://www.math.uni-hamburg.de/home/loewe/). My project is funded by a [doctoral scholarship](https://www.studienstiftung.de/en/promotion/) of the [Studienstiftung des deutschen Volkes](https://www.studienstiftung.de) (German Academic Scholarship Foundation). 

I will spend the academic year 2020/2021 at the [Faculty of Philosophy](https://www.phil.cam.ac.uk/) and [St John's College](https://www.joh.cam.ac.uk/) of the University of Cambridge. This stay is possible thanks to a scholarship of the [Prins Bernhard Cultuurfonds](https://www.cultuurfonds.nl/).

My general areas of interest are mathematical logic, the foundations of mathematics and their philosophy—currently I am particularly curious about the connections of foundational systems and their logics.
