I am a scientist working at the researc group Embedded Systems Innovation [ESI](https://esi.nl) of the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research [TNO](https://tno.nl).

I recently finished a PhD in mathematical logic at the [Institute for Logic, Language and Computation](http://www.illc.uva.nl) (ILLC) of the [University of Amsterdam](http://www.uva.nl/) (Research Unit: Mathematical & Computational Logic), supervised by [Professor Benedikt LÃ¶we](https://www.math.uni-hamburg.de/home/loewe/) and [Professor Rosalie Iemhoff](https://www.uu.nl/medewerkers/RIemhoff). My PhD research was partially funded by a [doctoral scholarship](https://www.studienstiftung.de/en/promotion/) of the [Studienstiftung des deutschen Volkes](https://www.studienstiftung.de).
