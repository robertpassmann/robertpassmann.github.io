I am a PhD candidate at the [ILLC](http://www.illc.uva.nl), University of Amsterdam, under the supervision of [Professor Benedikt Löwe](https://www.math.uni-hamburg.de/home/loewe/). My project is funded by a [doctoral scholarship](https://www.studienstiftung.de/en/promotion/) of the [Studienstiftung des deutschen Volkes](https://www.studienstiftung.de) (German Academic Scholarship Foundation). I'm interested in mathematical logic, the foundations of mathematics and their philosophy. Please use the navigation on top of the page to find information about my publications and research talks.

My last name _Paßmann_ is officially written with the German letter [_Eszett_ **ß**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ß) but in international contexts I usually use the spelling _Passmann_.
