I'm a logician interested in mathematical logic and the philosophy of logic. 

In *mathematical logic*, I'm mainly concerned with investigating logical properties of (non-classical) foundational mathematical theories. For example, I recently proved that the first-order logical principles valid in CZF set theory are exactly those of intuitionistic first-order logic by using realizability techniques (see [this preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.00486)). I am also interested in nearby areas such as interpretations of modal logic (provability logics, modal logics of forcing, etc.), categorical logic, ordinal computability theory, and non-classical logics in general. 

My main interests in the *philosophy of logic* and the *philosophy of mathematics* are anti-exceptionalism about logic, the debate surrounding logical pluralism as well as connections between logical and mathematical pluralism. I am particularly curious about investigating the philosophical ramifications of results in mathematical logic and pondering mathematical questions which originate from philosophical problems. 

I am currently a PhD candidate at the [Institute for Logic, Language and Computation](http://www.illc.uva.nl) of the [University of Amsterdam](http://www.uva.nl/) and my supervisor is [Professor Benedikt LÃ¶we](https://www.math.uni-hamburg.de/home/loewe/) (Research Unit: Mathematical & Computational Logic). My research is funded by a [doctoral scholarship](https://www.studienstiftung.de/en/promotion/) of the [Studienstiftung des deutschen Volkes](https://www.studienstiftung.de).
