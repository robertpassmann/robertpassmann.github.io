I am a PhD candidate at the [ILLC](http://www.illc.uva.nl), University of Amsterdam, under the supervision of [Professor Benedikt Löwe](https://www.math.uni-hamburg.de/home/loewe/). My project is funded by a [doctoral scholarship](https://www.studienstiftung.de/en/promotion/) of the [Studienstiftung des deutschen Volkes](https://www.studienstiftung.de) (German Academic Scholarship Foundation). 

My general areas of interest are mathematical logic, the foundations of mathematics and their philosophy—currently I am particularly curious about the connections of foundational systems and their logics.
