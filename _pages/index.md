I'm a logician working interdisciplinarily in philosophy and mathematics: my research interests span from mathematical and philosophical logic to the philosophy of logic and of mathematics. 

Currently, I'm a PhD candidate at the [Institute for Logic, Language and Computation](http://www.illc.uva.nl) (ILLC) of the [University of Amsterdam](http://www.uva.nl/) (Research Unit: Mathematical & Computational Logic). My supervisors are [Professor Benedikt LÃ¶we](https://www.math.uni-hamburg.de/home/loewe/) and [Professor Rosalie Iemhoff](https://www.uu.nl/medewerkers/RIemhoff). My research is funded by a [doctoral scholarship](https://www.studienstiftung.de/en/promotion/) of the [Studienstiftung des deutschen Volkes](https://www.studienstiftung.de).
