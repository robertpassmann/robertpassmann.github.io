I am working at the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research ([TNO](https://tno.nl)).

Prior to that, I obtained a PhD in mathematical logic at the [Institute for Logic, Language and Computation](http://www.illc.uva.nl) (ILLC) of the [University of Amsterdam](http://www.uva.nl/). My PhD research was partially funded by a [doctoral scholarship](https://www.studienstiftung.de/en/promotion/) of the [Studienstiftung des deutschen Volkes](https://www.studienstiftung.de).
