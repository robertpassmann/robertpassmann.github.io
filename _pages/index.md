I'm a logician interested in mathematical logic and the philosophy of logic. 

Currently, I am a PhD candidate at the [Institute for Logic, Language and Computation](http://www.illc.uva.nl) (Research Unit: Mathematical & Computational Logic) of the [University of Amsterdam](http://www.uva.nl/). My supervisor is [Professor Benedikt LÃ¶we](https://www.math.uni-hamburg.de/home/loewe/) and my project is funded by a [doctoral scholarship](https://www.studienstiftung.de/en/promotion/) of the [Studienstiftung des deutschen Volkes](https://www.studienstiftung.de). 

### News
- I'm co-organising the first *Dutch Logic PhD Day* to take place in early July â€“ stay tuned!
- I'm looking forward to visiting the [Bergen Logic Group](https://www.uib.no/en/rg/logic) ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡´ in May this year.
